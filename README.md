## Binaries

these are binaries i wrote in C and complied and put them in a folder exported to path so i can call from anywhere

it would be better to **write them in bash** they take half the space and are easiler to edit or write but i chosse C/C++

becuase am currently learning that , they still work, all the C code does is parse the text you pass into into it and translates and arranges them accordingly

and calls the **system()** function to out them into the terminal

### Install

clone the folder to home and run the **makefolderExecutable** to automatically add the folder to path or you can do it mannually

if **makefolderExecutable** doesnt run , make it executable by 

` sudo chmod 777 makefolderExecutable `
