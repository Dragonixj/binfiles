## Binaries

Just a bunch of scripts

## Install

added an installer that will **add the folder to path and source some files** <br/>
would work if this is cloned in your home folder and you use `zsh` or `bash` <br/>

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/potato-c137/binfiles
cd ~/binfiles
sudo chmod a+x *
./install.sh
```

or mannually just add the folder to path and source all files in `./.completions`

### Errors

i dunno of any yet

### Source Files

the **source codes** are located in `.src`
`./.completions` holds **bash completions** for binaries
