## Binaries

these are binaries i wrote in C and bash and complied and put them in a folder exported to path so i can call from anywhere, lil shortcuts

###### as of now not all are written in C ( mostly )

all the C code does is parse the text you pass into into it and translates and arranges them accordingly

and calls the **system()** function to run it , so think of it like an alias

### Install

clone the folder add the folder to path

### Errors

i dunno of any yet

### Source Files

the **source codes** are located in .src
